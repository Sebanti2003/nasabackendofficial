## Project Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies

To install the necessary dependencies for the project, run the following command in the root directory:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all required packages from the `package.json` file.

### 2. Create Folders for Static Assets

After installing the dependencies, create the following folder structure for your static assets:

- In the root directory, create a folder named `public`.
- Inside the `public` folder, create another folder named `images`.

You can do this by running:

```bash
mkdir -p public/images
```

Alternatively, you can manually create the folders using your file explorer.

### 3. Add Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory to manage environment-specific variables. Here's the format for your `.env` file:

```
PORT=5000
MONGO_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/your-database-name
```

- **`PORT`**: The port on which your server will run (e.g., `5000`).
- **`MONGO_URL`**: The connection string for your MongoDB database.

**Note**: Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` to ensure sensitive information like database connection strings are not exposed in your repository:

```bash
echo ".env" >> .gitignore
```

### 4. Run the Application

Once the dependencies are installed, and folders and environment variables are set up, you can run the application using:

```bash
npm run start
```

This will start the development server on the port you specified in your `.env` file.

### Additional Notes

- Ensure you have the necessary permissions and correct database credentials.
- For more information on extending this project or troubleshooting, refer to the codebase documentation or guidelines provided.

---

This `README.md` now uses `npm run start` as the command to start the whole application.
